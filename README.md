# 2024_UK_Election_SNP_Voteshare_Change
A map showing the change in SNP vote share from 2019 to 2024, in the 2024 UK general election in Scotland the SNP who had previously 
dominated Scotland electorally since 2015 and were powerful enough to push for an unsuccessful Scottish independence was completely
decimated electorally facing a loss of 39 seats with labour winning a supermajority of Scotland's seats. The SNP faced its heaviest
losses in the old labour heartland of the Scottish central belt and held up comparatively better in parts of the highlands where it 
had deep roots, its vote share also held up more securely in the Scottish borderlands which are dominated by conservatives.
